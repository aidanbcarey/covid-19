# data
the first piece of data in this repo is the census 2010 data, as in ./data/census-landarea-all.csv, you may find it very helpful in COVID-19 analytics as it contains data ranging from regional economy, population, density and land area, so on so forth. we found this data thru [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/County_statistics_of_the_United_States), which pointed to the original data at [WayBackMachine](https://web.archive.org/web/20130930014430/http://quickfacts.census.gov/qfd/download/DataSet.txt), the data README.txt file is simply a mirror of this [Archived Census Website](https://web.archive.org/web/20150807220054/http://quickfacts.census.gov/qfd/download_data.html)
